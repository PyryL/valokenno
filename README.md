## Setup development environment

<!--
Versions I used:
* IDE 2.3.6
* esp32 v3.2.1
* NeoPixel v1.15.1
-->

First, install Arduino IDE.
In Boards manager, install `esp32` by Espressif Systems.
In Library manager, install `Adafruit NeoPixel` by Adafruit.
Select `Adafruit Feather ESP32-S3 No PSRAM` from the board list.
You also want to disable USB CDC so the program can run without USB connection.
